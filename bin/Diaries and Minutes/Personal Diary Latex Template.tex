	\section{11-01-2019 - First Group Meeting}
	
	\subsection{Administrative}
	Daniel, Mottle, Sheneece, Leo, Brian, Reza, Benjamin, (missing 1 anonymous).
	
	Meeting from: 20:15 to 20:45\\
	Git tutorial: 20:45 to 21:20 (Thanks Mottle!)
	
	\subsection{Summary}
	We all met after class in another smaller room. We started by introducing ourselves and then went on to deciding who would do what role for the first iteration of the project. Ben, Brian, and the anonymous guy would handle coding. Leo, Sheneece, and Reza would be on documentation. Sheneece is from abroad and is catching up in Java by doing COMP 249 (she knows C++ though) so she wanted to sit out the coding part to give her time to learn the syntax of Java. Mottle seems to have the most industry experience so I decided to pair up with him so that I could learn the ropes (Git, SQLite, Maven, etc.). Leo and I are meeting tomorrow and he will show me what he knows about making a GUI in Eclipse using Window Builder.
	
	Encouraged by the quality and skill in the team. I am hoping that I can learn a lot from them as I am clearly not at their level. I need to get up to speed fast.
	
	\subsection{Agreed upon goals}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Read the project outline.
		\item Take a look at all the tools we're gonna use over the project.
		\item Confirm time for next meeting.
		\item Think through how you would do the project on your own. 
		\item Make sure you have access to the repo and Discord server. 
		\item Say hello to the rest of the team.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Miscellaneous}
	I really feel like I need to catch up to the other team members. I think most of them are much farther into their degrees than I. Regardless, I will do my best to pull my weight.
