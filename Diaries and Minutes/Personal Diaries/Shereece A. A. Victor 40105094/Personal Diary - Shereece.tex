\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Project Description}
According to my understanding thus far, Codenames Game, is a spy themed card game, designed for play with four or more persons. It involves, two Spymasters, and Operatives. The players are divided into two teams, a red team and a blue team. 

The game is played with a mixture of red and blue cards placed faced down on the table in a 5x5 grid. The contents and placement of each card are only known to each spymaster. The cards each contain a word which is visible to all, and either a red or blue spy, uncolored civilian or the assassin. 

Throughout the game each team’s spymaster is tasked with provided clues that indicated how many and the location of their color spies on the board. The first team to figure out the location of all their spies wins. If either team reveals the assassin, they lose and the game ends. 

The goal of my team’s project to recreate this game in a computer program in three iterations. The first, gives the user minimum input, and the last allows the a user to participate in the game.

\subsection{Summary}
-	To begin the meeting, we played the card game, Codenames, to familiarize ourselves with the gameplay and rules. \\
-	After the game I understood finally understood the game. \\
-	I presented by idea of using a 5x5 matrix data structure to represent the game board and assigning each of the matrix’s contents to a one-dimensional array for ease of use. Then using a random function to assign the cards to each space. \\
-	MZ initiated the discussion of how we would implement the game and spoke about logical game design using objects.\\
-	SZ and BT retaught the MVC model, because we were still unclear of it. \\
-	We all participated in a discussion about where the logic of the system would be contained, if it would be in the controller or the model. \\
-	We discovered that our group had been expanded and thus we went to the lab to meet them. \\

\subsection{Summary}
-	I discussed Use Cases and the game play with RZ.\\ 
-	I wrote meeting minutes from meeting 2. \\
-	I shared tasks to do as detailed by TA with the team. \\
-	I reread through and understood the code. The MVC model makes sense to me now. \\
-	RZ, MZ and I discussed how the game is played; whether it’s automatically ran through or if the user must keep pressing next. I was unsure whether that was the method being implemented because MZ confused me by saying the user just starts the game and it plays until the end. \\
-	We discussed, how the undo and redo button would work in both cases.  \\
-	We looped in CS since he coordinates the coding process. I was right, the game progresses only as the user presses a ‘next’ or ‘next play’ button. \\
-	I started the Domain Model. \\
