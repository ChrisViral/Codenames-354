\section{Project Analysis and Development Plan}

	\subsection{Introduction}
	
	 The purpose of this document is to detail the high-level requirements and features of the Codenames Game developed by team PJ-B. The Codenames Game is a game of 4 human and AI players. This project is an adaptation of the Codenames Game designed by Vlada Chv\'atil and published by Czech games.\\
	 \\
	 The specifics of how the Codenames Game fulfills these needs will be detailed in the use cases which more will be detailed in the upcoming design phase\\
	
	\subsection{Purpose}
	
	This document will describe the specifications entailed by the development of Codenames in compliance with the requirements of COMP 354. It will outline the high-level requirements encompassing user interfaces, product functions, user descriptions, assumptions and dependencies, constraints, specific requirements and an analysis model. The analysis model will hold use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams and state transition diagrams.
	
	\subsection{Scope}
	
	%UPDATES ON FURTHER ITERATIONS
	This document only addresses the high level requirements of Codenames  that the design phase entails. The analysis model will contain UML diagrams used to serve multiple purposes. The Use case diagrams will give an overview of the functions of the project and how users will interact with it. The class diagrams will show the interactions between different objects in the game. \\
	

	\subsection{Definitions and Abbreviations}
	
		\subsubsection{Definitions}
	
		\textbf{Board} \\
		\\
		The main playing area will be composed of a 5 by 5 grid of words. Each cell of the grid are representative of Codenames of agents. Each cell in the grid will be defined in this document as a \textit{Card}.\\
	
		\textbf{Card} \\
		\\
		The card will hold two values indicative of it's state: hidden or revealed. In its hidden state, it will present a word taken from the game. In its revealed state, it can either be a blue or red team's \textit{Spy} card, a \textit{Civilian} card or the \textbf{Assassin} card.\\
		
		\textbf{Assassin} \\
		The Assassin is a card type that when revealed, it would cause the team that revealed it to lose.\\
		
		\textbf{Spy}\\
		\\
		The Spy is a card type that belongs to either the red or blue team. Once all spy cards of a team are revealed, the team wins.
		
		\textbf{Civilian}\\
		\\
		The Civilian is a card type that occupies leftover space on the board that is not occupied by \textit{Spy} cards or the \textit{Assassin} card. When revealed, it only skips the revealing team's turn. \\
	
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	
	The rest of this document outlines the problem description and the development plan. \\ 
	\\  
	The problem description will describe the game user's interfaces, product functions, user descriptions, assumptions and dependencies, constraints, specification requirements, and the analysis model. \\  
	
	\clearpage
	
\section{Problem Description}

	\subsection{Project Purpose, Scope, and Objectives}
	
	% Update for each iteration
	The objective of this project is to simulate a multi-user tabletop game named Codenames game by by Vlada Chv\'atil and published by Czech games. The rules of the game will intimately follow Vlada Chv\'atil with slight variations to accommodate the digital conversion. This project will be a multi-user game of up to four players; these players can be either human or computer players.\\
	
	By working on this project, Team PJ-b can experience the software engineering process entailing the difficulties in managing a group project.\\
	
	The project will be worked on over 3 iterations whereby they are the requirement phase, the design phase, and the test phase.
	
		\subsubsection{User interface}
		
		%Update by later iterations
		As this is the requirement phase, we are keeping the interface to a minimum design. They will not preface any visual grace but present the most useful information at the time. The visual representation of the game is as shown below:\\
		
		\begin{center}
			Figure 1:The playable menu of the current game version
			\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{game_interface.png}
			
		\end{center}
	
		\textbf{Board}\\
		\\
		The board is represented by a 5 by 5 set of cards, each possessing a word that when revealed, it will change in color to present what is the card type. When revealed, the card will be of a specific color to determine its value:  
		    \begin{itemize}
		        \item Red is a red spy.
		        \item Blue is a blue spy.
		        \item Black is \textit{the Assassin}.
		        \item Peach is a Civilian.
		    \end{itemize}
		    
	    \textbf{Round}\\
	    \\
	    On the top left, the "\textit{Round}" text represents the number of rounds that have passed in the game in accordance to the numerical value next to it.\\
	    
	    \textbf{Phase}\\
	    \\
	    On the top left, the "\textit{Phase}" text details the current player in action. This value would be either one of these at a time:
	        \begin{itemize}
	            \item Blue Spymaster
	            \item Blue Operative
	            \item Red Spymaster
	            \item Red Operative
	        \end{itemize}
	   
	   \textbf{Score-Keeping}\\
	   \\
	   In the middle top, Two sections with the text "\textit{Red}" and "\textit{Blue}" denotes the number of spies revealed for each team to the number of cards left to revealed. This is done in the format of:\\
	   
	   "Number of spies revealed / Total Number of spies"\\
	   
	   \textbf{Guesses}\\
	   \\
	    On the top right, the text "\textit{Guesses}" denotes the number of guesses left to be made by the \textit{Operative} given to by the \textit{Spymaster}. The value is formatted in: \\
	    
	   " Number of Guesses Left / Maximum Number of Guesses "\\
	   
	   \textbf{Clue}\\
	   \\
	   On the top right, the clue given by the \textit{Spymaster} will be displayed here.\\
	   
	   \textbf{Undo/Redo}\\
	   \\
	   On the bottom left, Two buttons of "\textit{Undo}" and "\textit{Redo}" functions as a point to click to control the turns elapsed. The \textit{Undo} button reverses a turn so long as it is made. The \textit{Redo} button replays a turn that was affected by \textit{Undo}.\\
	   
	   \textbf{Next Move}\\
	   \\
	   On the bottom right, the "\textit{Next Move}" button serves as a platform to click to progress the game forward by a turn.\\
	   
	 
	
%	\subsection{Product Functions}
%	
%	Every function below has to support system  functions, such as a click of a button or revealing images when necessary. The following functions will be a part of the Codenames game.\\
%	
%		\subsubsection{Introduction}
%		
%		The user is first introduced to the game. Since human players are currently not being implemented into the game, only the "Start Game" button is visible. \\
%		
%		Input:
%		    \begin{itemize}
%		        \item The user clicks the "\textit{Start Game}" button.
%		    \end{itemize}
%	    
%		Action:
%		    \begin{itemize}
%		        \item 4 computer players are created: 2 for each team with each either being a \textit{Spymaster} or \textit{Operative}.
%		        \item 25 words are randomly picked from a database.
%		        \item The starting team is randomly picked.
%		    \end{itemize}
%		
%		Output:
%		    \begin{itemize}
%		        \item The teams are defined.
%		        \item A pool of words in use for the game are kept in an array.
%		        \item A turn order is decided.
%		    \end{itemize}
%		    
%		Validity Check:
%		    \begin{itemize}
%		        \item 
%		    \end{itemize}
%		
%		\subsubsection{Board}
%		
%		To be updated.\\
%		
%		\subsubsection{Game}
%		
%		There will be two teams of \textbf{red} and \textbf{blue}. Each team possesses a pair of players each playing either the role of Spymaster of Operative. Since each team follows the same path:\\
%		
%		\begin{itemize}
%			\item [--] Team \textit{Spymaster} reveals clue.
%			\item [--] Turn passes to Team's \textit{Operative}
%			\item [--] Team \textit{Operative} makes guesses based on clue given.
%			\item [--] Turn passes to opposing team's \textit{Spymaster}
%		\end{itemize}
%	
%		\textbf{Input:}\\
%		To be updated.\\
%		\\
%		\textbf{Action:}
%		To be updated.\\
%		\\
%		\textbf{Output:}\\
%		To be updated.\\
%		\\
%		\textbf{Validity Check:}\\
%		Sequence of the players is to be followed according to the order set earlier established. When a team finishes their turn, the next team's turn becomes active.\\
%		
	
	\subsection{Constraints}
	
	Assuming that a majority of player's PCs will run by the Windows OS, the project must be written in this platform that supports GUI.Thus, the decision has been made to use :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[--] JAVA as the programming language.
		\item[--] SQLite as chosen for data storage.
		\item[--] JUnit for unit testing.
		\item[--] Eclipse as the integrated development environment(IDE).
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Analysis Models}
	
		\subsubsection{Use Case Diagrams}
		
		The following diagarams will help provide an overview of the functions in the game. They describe the action that a player can perform, as well as the interaction between some of the system functions which are not directly controlled by the player.\\
		
		These use case diagrams are included due to their importance in defining the user-to-software interactions, the requirements, and the scope of the system.\\
		
		The section below will detail the actors involved in the game: \\
		    
		    \textbf{User} \\
		    \\
		    The User represents the human player. For this iteration there is only one User. The User is able to control the chronological flow of the game via the use cases detailed below which are "\textit{Undo}", "\textit{Redo}", "\textit{Next Turn}", and "\textit{Start Game}".\\
		    
		    \textbf{Spymaster}\\
		    \\
		    The Spymaster is involved in the game by doling out clues. As there are only two teams, there will only be two Spymasters in the game. The Spymaster hands out clues via the "\textit{Reveal Clue}" use case detailed below.\\
		    
		    \textbf{Operative}\\
		    \\
		    The Operative is involved in the game by revealing cards in accordance to the clue and number of guesses given to by the Spymaster actor. As there are two teams, there will be only two Operatives in the game. The operative reveals cards through the use case "\textit{Reveal CARD}" use case as detailed below.\\

		The Game consists of a game board with cards which can either be revealed or unrevealed during the game. When cards are not yet revealed they show a word. Each card has a type, it is either a spy, a civilian or the Assassin. When cards are revealed they show their type. There can only be one assassin card per game. Each spy belongs to a team, red or blue. 
		
		The game also contains players which interact with the game. Each player, like the spies, belong to either the red or blue team.

			This class diagram for the Codenames game does not show all the components of the final classes and interfaces. Instead it shows how some of the concepts presented in the domain model can be implemented.  
			
			The commander contains most of the functions the user interacts with, the controller carries out those functions by triggering methods in other parts of the system. The card flipped event for example, can  be triggered when the user presses the 'undo' button. This is received by the commander, which passes it to the controller, which triggers the card flipped event, revealing or hiding a crad on the game board within the game.

				\item During play the rules, were clarified and discussed. We also confirmed and questioned what taunts and interactions are allowed by players.   
			\end{itemize}
			The game is quite fun. We understand the game play better now. 
			
			\paragraph{Approaches to Game Architecture  }
			\begin{itemize}
				\item SV presented a possible method using a 2x2 matrix for the game board representation, assigning each block a number from 1 to 25 and using random functions to assign red and blue card placement along with other cards on the board. 
				\item MZ lead a discussion of the logical design of the game using objects.
				\item SZ and BT explained the concept of MVC (Model View Controller)
				\item We discussed whether the Controller or the Model contains the logic of the system.
				\item Discovered that the group was expanded and thus we proceeded to the lab to meet the rest of the group. 
			\end{itemize}
			We need to ask the lecturer to clarify MVC. 
			
			\subsubsection{Agreed upon goals}
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Ask the lecturer about MVC in class. 
			\end{itemize}
