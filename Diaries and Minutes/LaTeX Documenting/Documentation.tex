\section{Project Analysis and Development Plan}

	\subsection{Introduction}
	
	 The purpose of this document is to detail the high-level requirements and features of the Codenames Game developed by team PB-J. The Codenames Game is a game of 2 to 8 human and AI players. This project is an adaptation of the Codenames Game designed by Vlada Chv\'atil and published by Czech games.\\
	 \\
	 The specifics of how the Codenames Game fulfills these needs will be detailed in the use cases which more will be detailed in the upcoming design phase\\
	
	\subsection{Purpose}
	
	This document will describe the specifications entailed by the development of Codenames in compliance with the requirements of COMP 354. It will outline the high-level requirements encompassing user interfaces, product functions, user descriptions, assumptions and dependancies, constraints, specific requirements and an analysis model. The analysis model will hold use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams and state transition diagrams.
	
	\subsection{Scope}
	
	%UPDATES ON FURTHER ITERATIONS
	This document only addresses the high level requirements of Codenames  that the design phase entails. The analysis model will contain UML diagrams used to serve multiple purposes. The Use case diagrams will give an overview of the functions of the project and how users will interact with it. The class diagrams will show the interactions between different objects in the game. \\
	

	\subsection{Definitions and Abbreviations}
	
		\subsubsection{Definitions}
	
		\textbf{Board} \\
		\\
		The main playing area will be composed of a 5 by 5 grid of words. Each cell of the grid are representative of codenames of agents. Each cell in the grid will be defined in this document as a \textit{Card}.\\
	
		\textbf{Card} \\
		\\
		The card will hold two values indicative of it's state: unrevealed
		and revealed. In it's unrevealed state, it will present a word taken from the game. In it's revealed state, it can either be a blue or red team's \textit{Spy} card, a \textit{Civillian} card or the \textbf{Assassin} card.\\
		
		\textbf{Assassin} \\
		The Assassin is a card type that when revealed, it would cause the team that revealed it to lose.\\
		
		\textbf{Spy}\\
		\\
		The Spy is a card type that belongs to either the red or blue team. Once all spy cards of a team are revealed, the team wins.
		
		\textbf{Civillian}\\
		\\
		The Civillian is a card type that occupies leftover space on the board that is not occupied by \textit{Spy} cards or the \textit{Assassin} card. When revealed, it only skips the revealing team's turn. \\
	
		\subsubsection{Abbreviations}
		
		To be updated. \\

	To be updated.\\
	
	\subsection{Overview}
	
	The rest of this document outlines the problem description and the development plan. \\ 
	\\  
	The problem description will describe the game user's interfaces, product functions, user descriptions, assumptions and dependencies, constraints, specification requirements, and the analysis model. \\

\section{Problem Description}

	\subsection{Project Purpose, Scope, and Objectives}
	
	% Update for each iteration
	The objective of this project is to simulate a multi-user tabletop game named Codenames game by by Vlada Chv\'atil and published by Czech games. The rules of the game will intimately follow Vlada Chv\'atil with slight variations to accomodate the digital conversion. This project will be a multi-user game of up to four players composed of currently only computer players.\\
	
			
	\subsection{Product Functions}
	
	Every function below has to support system  functions, such as a click of a button or revealing images when necessary. The following functions will be a part of the Codenames game.\\
	
		\subsubsection{Introduction}
		
		To be updated.\\
		
		\subsubsection{Board}
		
		To be updated.\\
		
		\subsubsection{Game}
		
		There will be two teams of \textbf{red} and \textbf{blue}. Each team possesses a pair of players each playing either the role of Spymaster of Operative. Since each team follows the same path:\\
		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item [--] Team \textit{Spymaster} reveals clue.
			\item [--] Turn passes to Team's \textit{Operative}
			\item [--] Team \textit{Operative} makes guesses based on clue given.
			\item [--] Turn passes to opposing team's \textit{Spymaster}
		\end{itemize}
	
		\textbf{Input:}\\
		To be updated.\\
		\\
		\textbf{Action:}
		To be updated.\\
		\\
		\textbf{Output:}\\
		To be updated.\\
		\\
		\textbf{Validity Check:}\\
		Sequence of the players is to be followed according to the order set earlier established. When a team finishes their turn, the next team's turn becomes active.\\
		
		
	\subsection{User Description}
	
		\subsubsection{User Environment}
		
		\subsubsection{User Profiles}
		
	\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
	
	\subsection{Constraints}
	
	Assuming that a majority of player's PCs will run by the Windows OS, the project must be written in this platform that suports GUI.Thus, the decision has been made touse :
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[--] JAVA as the programming language.
		\item[--] SQLite as chosen for data storage.
		\item[--] JUnit for unit testing.
		\item[--] Eclipse as the integrated development environment(IDE).
	\end{itemize}
		
	
	\subsection{Specific Requirements}
	
	\subsection{Analysis Models}
	
		\subsubsection{Use Case Diagrams}
		
		The following diagarams will help provide an overview of the functions in the game. They describe the action that a player can perform, as well as the interaction between some of the system functions which are not directly controlled by the player.\\
		
		These use case diagrams are included due to their importance in defining the user-to-software interactions, the requirements, and the scope of the system.\\
